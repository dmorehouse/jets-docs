Why is importmap preferred over webpack?

DHH covers a lot of the move from node tools like esbuild, rollup.js, and webpack in this [blog post](https://world.hey.com/dhh/rails-7-will-have-three-great-answers-to-javascript-in-2021-8d68191b). Here are a few more notes on why I think the move was probably made.

The node and javascript toolchain and libraries move quickly. In some ways, this is great for rapid innovation. However, it can make it a horrible experience for someone who does not work on node and javascript daily basis. One of the top visited pages from the boltops/jets community forums is for [webpack issues](https://community.boltops.com/t/webpack-has-been-initialised-using-a-configuration-object-that-does-not-match-the-api-schema/118). ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

From real-world experience, a npm package is upgraded every couple of months and breaks webpack backward compatible with other libraries or old configuration schema settings. It's the wild west.

* Have seen schema or interfaces for configurations like `babel.config.js`, `.browserslistrc`, `config/webpacker/environment.js`, `postcss.config.js`, `config/webpacker.yml` change in breaking ways.
* Here are just some examples: [webpacker 2059](https://github.com/rails/webpacker/issues/2059), [webpacker 2202](https://github.com/rails/webpacker/issues/2202), [webpacker 2342](https://github.com/rails/webpacker/issues/2342), [jetpacker 4](https://github.com/tongueroo/jetpacker/pull/4)
* The error messages are not generally that great, particularly when webpack breaks. I have read a few javascript books Douglas Crockford JavaScript books: "JavaScript: The Good Parts" and "How JavaScript Works", and also have both worked with reactjs and vuejs. I've have even release packages to npm.
* Found the javascript world can still be a frustrating experience. Maybe for a node/javascript everyday developer, the error messages are more clear.
* I Have found it's usually faster to treat things like a black box when there have been webpack issues. IE: Upgrade yarn, node, and regenerate the configuration files and see if that fixes issues. Sometimes have to dig deeper, and that takes a decent amount of time.

The hope of importmap is that we avoid the javascript toolchain altogether. There's no need to install specific versions of node and yarn to build packages and fix issues every couple of months when a package decides to introduce compatibility issues. Instead, we can use sprockets to build assets to bypass the javascript rabbithole.
